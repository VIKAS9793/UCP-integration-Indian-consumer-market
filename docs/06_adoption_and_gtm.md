## Stakeholder Incentive Analysis

### Who Needs to Say Yes?

| Stakeholder | Incentive to Adopt | Barrier to Adoption |
|-------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| **Consumers** | Faster checkout, fewer passwords | Trust in AI payments, COD preference |
| **Merchants** | Reduced abandonment (70% → 50%?), new channels | Integration effort, unclear ROI |
| **Platforms (AI)** | Native commerce = increased engagement | Requires merchant network effect |
| **Payment Providers** | More transaction volume | UCP may commoditize their value-add |
