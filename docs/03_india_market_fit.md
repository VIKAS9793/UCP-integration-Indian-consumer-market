## India-Specific Constraints

### 1. UPI Dominance — Enables UCP ✅

**Reality:**
- UPI processed 228 billion transactions worth ₹300 lakh crore in 2025
- 83.7% of digital payment volume
- Strong infrastructure for linked payments

**UCP Fit:** High (4/5) — UPI's standardization aligns with UCP's payment interoperability vision.

### 2. COD Culture — Blocks UCP ❌

**Reality:**
- 60-65% of e-commerce orders use Cash on Delivery
- 25-30% RTO (Return to Origin) rate for COD orders
- Trust deficit drives COD preference, especially in Tier 2/3 cities

**UCP Fit:** Low (1/5) — UCP is prepaid-first. COD orders can't leverage checkpoint benefits.

**So What?** UCP must target prepaid-heavy segments or risk irrelevance in majority of transactions.

### 3. Trust & Returns Anxiety — Mixed Fit ⚠️

**Reality:**
- 35% of non-metro shoppers prefer COD due to fraud concerns
- 10% of Tier 2/3 shoppers report experiencing fraud (non-delivery, payment scams)
- Returns policy is top 3 purchase decision factor

**UCP Fit:** Medium (2/5) — AI-initiated purchases may increase trust anxiety. Consumer education required.

### 4. Marketplace Dominance — Low Incentive for UCP ❌

**Reality:**
- Amazon + Flipkart control ~60% of e-commerce GMV
- Both have optimized proprietary checkouts
- No incentive to adopt open protocol that reduces lock-in

**UCP Fit:** Low (1/5) — Major platforms unlikely early adopters.

### 5. D2C Readiness — Strong Entry Point ✅

**Reality:**
- ₹7.5 lakh crore market by 2025, growing 25% CAGR
- 50%+ revenue from Tier 2/3 cities
- Many brands on Shopify (UCP partner) with Razorpay integration

**UCP Fit:** High (4/5) — D2C brands have both motivation (reduce abandonment) and technical readiness.
